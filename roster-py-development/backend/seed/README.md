# Seeds file

This file (directory?) prepares a default seed state for the application. This should be run automatically whenever the application starts for the first time (i.e. when `./run.sh` is executed[?])

Actions:
* Populate database with dummy data
  * Create dummy dancers
  * Create dummy team(s)
  * Create dummy user(s) with varying levels of permission.

*tl;dr* the purpose of seeding is to allow the developers to quickly validate that the backend and database are working as intended. <br>
**TODO** The purpose of seeding is to:
1. ???

**TODO** implement this shitttttt
